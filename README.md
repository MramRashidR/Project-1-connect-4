# Project-1-connect-4

In this project, Connect 4, a game that I used to play, was completed online instead of the more traditional process.
The popular cartoon (Tom and Jerry) is the inspiration for this game. Each player will select one of them and attempt to win by connecting four pieces either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

This game relies heavily on JavaScript, so DOM manipulation was utilized to provide it. Numerous functions were used from the game's initialization until its reset.


Sadly, the winner has not yet been recognized, so feel free to contact us with any other suggestions.


Game instructions :
emphasize the importance of beginning with the bottom cells. Next, decide whether to play as the first or second player to determine your preferred character. Try to place your character in four connected positions to win.
